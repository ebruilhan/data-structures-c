# Heap Data Structure

This folder contains basic implementations and examples of the Heap data structure in C.

A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:
- In a **Max Heap**, the parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
- In a **Min Heap**, the parent node is less than or equal to its children.

## This folder includes:
- Heap creation and initialization
- Insertion into heap
- Deletion from heap
- Heapify operation
