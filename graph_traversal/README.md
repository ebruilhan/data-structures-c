# Graph Traversal

This folder contains basic graph traversal algorithms implemented in C.

Covered topics:
- Graph representation (adjacency matrix / adjacency list)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Traversal examples with explanations

The examples are intended for learning fundamental graph traversal concepts in data structures.
